## UTKL Group – Design, Simulation of PET & other Gamma Detectors \hfill Jan 2020 – May 2022
 - Simulation of Positron Emission Tomography Detectors (PET) and similar gamma-matter interactions
 - Currently simulating a novel 1-meter barrel PET which would employ inexpensive plastic scintillators
 - Assisted with simulation of an extruded plastic wavelength shifter alternative for the LEGEND experiment
 - Using Geant4, ROOT and Python via CMake, Bash and the Linux environment (C++). 
 - Implemented machine learning and statistical algorithms including a KNN and CNN
 - Meeting with Dr. Lang of UT Austin and others bi-weekly to discuss progress and refinements
 - Video and presentation [here](https://akhilsadam.github.io/projects/research/), analysis code [here](https://github.com/akhilsadam/PlasticPET-ANLY/tree/master), and simulation code [here](https://github.com/akhilsadam/Geant4-PET/tree/master)

## Phonon Momentum Group – Experiment Design, Theory & Analysis	\hfill Aug 2020 – May 2022
 - Initial experiment design and estimates of phonon angular momentum measurement
 - Using a high-Q double torsional oscillator and the Einstein-de Haas effect
 - Using Python to fit resonances and calculate forces from capacitive and fiber-optic-interferometry
 - Initial findings were presented by the group at the APS (American Physical Society) March 2022 meeting
 - Meeting with Dr. Markert of UT Austin and others weekly to discuss progress and refinements
 - Presentation [here](https://akhilsadam.github.io/projects/research/)
